    <h1>Alley Asters</h1>
    <p>Alley asters is a volunteer-run ecological gardening program in St. Louis, Missouri, with the mission of beautifying they alleys of South City with native perennial plants. We convert unloved alley spaces into ecologically productive native habitat.</p>
    <p>Why we work on/in alleys:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Community members tend to be less concerned (or not concerned at all) with the formality of alley plantings, which means they are more likely to allow these spaces to be converted to natives compared to their front/back gardens. Therefore, they're an excellent opporunity to introduce our community to native plants.</li>
      <li>Unloved alley spots usually often host invasive species, so this works allows us to remove them.</li>
      <li>Alley soil tends to be unimproved, allowing native plants to survive/thrive.</li>
      <li>Alleys are frequently used by local community members, offering neighbors an opportunity to deeply learn the lifeycle of native plants in their alley.</li>
    </ul>
